# EJS Starter

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of working with EJS (Embedded JavaScript), a templating language that enables developers to write HTML markup with embedded JavaScript.

## Features

- Simple Express server setup
- Integration of EJS as the templating engine
- Basic routing to render EJS templates

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ericstober/ejs-starter.git
cd ejs-starter
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:5000/

## Project Structure

```
ejs-starter/
├── views/
│   └── index.ejs
├── app.js
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

- `views/`: Contains EJS templates.
- `app.js`: Main application file where the Express server is configured.

## Usage

This starter template is ideal for those looking to understand how EJS integrates with Express. It serves as a foundation for building more complex applications that require server-side rendering.
